# Introduction 💻:

"255" is a project motivated by the curiosity of how machine learning is able to read and classify pictures as we human beings do.

# Goal 💡: 

✈️When traveling I always have issues to convert currencies, thus my goal is to creat a currency converter based in image recognition. 
✍️I am going to create a product concept of 255.

### 1. Number detection
In order to detect numbers of images I have used to models:

  🎈Convolutional neural network - CNN. In deep learning,is a class of deep neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. I have used 135 csv ***(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Font+Images)*** to train my model, which has been the Sequential model. ***(Sequential model is a linear stack of layers. You create a sequential model by calling the keras_model_sequential () function then a series of layer functions)***
  
  🎈Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images. After exploring the CNN I have decided to use the Pytesseract tool, which eases the OCR process.
  
### 2 . Currency converter
  💰 As my main goal is to create a currency converter based on images I have used google-currency to do so. It can convert the currency of 153 codes.
  ⭐Disclaimer: google-currency package fetch the result from Google using web scrapping. Owner will not be responsible for any misuse of this package. This is solely for the purpose of learning.

### 3. Outcome 
  🕸️After navigating the data and choosing the best tool to process the images, which have been then converted. I have created a Streamlit app, where you can see 255 product concept.
